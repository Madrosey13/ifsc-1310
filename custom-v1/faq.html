    <h3>What made you decide to take on this project?</h3>
    <p>As mentioned on our home page, an anonymous folder was given 
        to us mentioning this show. It is not known who or where this 
        anonymous person is, but we thank them for giving us this project.
    </p>

    <h3>How many people are in the team?</h3>
    <p>To protect our privacy, we perfer not to say.</p>

    <h3>What is known so far about the show?</h3>
    <p>So far we only know about the characters (or some of them). Recently, 
        we discovered that this cartoon would've aired sometime around weekday 
        mornings. The current theory is that the station that aired this show was 
        a public access channel, which would explain why we are having a hard time 
        finding more about this show.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the M.M.A.C open for volunteers?</h3>
    <p>Currently, we are not looking for any more help. Thank 
        you for asking though.
    </p>

    <h3>Is this website managed by the M.M.A.C?</h3>
    <p>This webiste is managed by a member of the M.M.A.C..</p>
