    <h2>Come one. Come All!</h2>
    <p>Welcome fellow viewers to a show you've never seen. For years, this forgotten cartoon has gone under
        the radar for many years. Until now! We at the Missing Media Archival Committee (M.M.A.C) 
        are hard at work to find evidence of a cartoon that was believed to have never exist.</p>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The M.M.A.C consists of a group of archivists that scourage through VHS tapes and other internet archives
    to find the most obscure pieces of lost media. Recently, an anonymous tip was given to us about 
    a supposedly forgotten animated cartoon that supposedly aired from the early 70s to the late 80s. 
    The purpose of this website is to get our message out to the public eye in hopes to find more people who have 
    remembered seeing this obscure cartoon.
</p>
<p>
    If you some how do remember this piece of lost media, please reach out to us on our contact page! 
    We'd love to hear from you!
