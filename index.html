  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>Web accessibility is importaint in the modern world. Since we live in a world of technology, it can be hard to understand the needs of other people who have difficulties 
    with it. People who have difficulties hearing may require subtitles, and people who cannot see certian colors may have a hard time comprehending your website. An important
   thing to remember while working on a website is to think to yourself, <em>If I had this accsesibility problem, would I understand this website?</em>. If you cannot understand 
   the website, you probally haven't made it accsesibility friendly.
  </p>

<h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Progressive Enhancement Article</a></p>
<p>The term "progressive enhancement" is a design philosophy. It is defined by providing a baseline of essential context and functionality to as many users as possible,
  while delivering the best possible experience to only users of modern browsers, so long as the browsers can run the code. Progressive enhancement can be broken up into
  three pieces. The first piece is the "content", or the HTML that is used to code the website. The second piece is the "presentation", which is the CSS that is used to make 
  the website look pretty. The final piece is the "client-side scripting", this is where JavaScript is used to make the website interacive for the user. An anology of this process
  is often likened to a layer cake, since there are three primary layers used.
</p>
<p>The reason why progressive enhancement is important to modern web-development is that it allows web devolpers to focus on developing the best possible website while making sure that
  website works on multiple unknown agents. It also allows developers to structure their websites better and not mix one layer with another.
