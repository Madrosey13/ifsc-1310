  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>Web accessibility is importaint in the modern world. Since we live in a world of technology, it can be hard to understand the needs of other people who have difficulties with it. People who have difficulties hearing may require subtitles, and people who cannot see certian colors may have a hard time comprehending your website. An important thing to remember while working on a website is to think to yourself, <em>If I had this accsesibility problem, would I understand this website?</em>. If you cannot understand the website, you probally haven't made it accsesibility friendly.</p>
