            <p><strong>Gordo</strong> was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.</p>
            <p>Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minure flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes, the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientits monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.</p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Gordo was a South American species of squirrle monkey, about one foot tall and weighing between 1 and 1.5 kg. He was chosen for space travel because of his species' similar anatomical makeup to man and sensitivity to changes in temperature.</p>
            <p>Missions using monkeys in space were not new at the time: four monkeys called Albert, as well as monkeys called Patricia and Mike, had all flown by 1962.</p>

      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Caveral, travel further than any monkey had ever traveled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.</p>
       <blockquote>"We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work."</blockquote>

<h2>The Jupiter AM-13</h2>
<p>The  <strong>Jupiter IRBM</strong> (<strong>Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile</strong>) was originally developed by the U.S. Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United State's early strategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>

<h2>The Journey</h2>
<p>Gordo wore a specially customized space suit. Made for a monkey about one foot tall. The space unit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones. Microphones recorded his histrocial suborbital journey, which is considered one of the outstanding achievemnts of space research.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Gordo was weightless for 8.3 minutes, as the craft exited and re-enterd the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of over 10,000 miles per hour. The faliure of Gordo's parachute meant that both he and the capsule were lost, despite efforts to recover them. It was believed that Gordo was alive at the time of impact.</p>
<p>Dispite the loss of Gordo, the mission was considered a success by NASA. It had gone some way towards alleviating the concerns over how the human body would cope with weightlessness and the difficulties of space travel. Less than a year later, Gordo was followed into space by the monkeys Able and Baker, who survived a similar launch profile.</p>
